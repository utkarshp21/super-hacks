# midway
Helps users pick entertainment places that lie midway a long the route between any two given geographic coordinates. A user may select his mode of travel (walking, driving or bicycling or public transit) and select two locations. The path will be traced on the map and markers will be placed, midway along the route and at places in range of that point.
